# Inversion of Control

In a nutshell, pretty much every component renders through the `<Generic>` component.
This means that those components take advantage of all the [Bulma modifiers](https://bulma.io/documentation/modifiers/), **by taking any prop that [`<Generic>`](/base/generic) accepts**.

These components, created with `forwardRefAs` – a sort of wrapper on React's [`forwardRef`](https://reactjs.org/docs/forwarding-refs.html) - can render themselves as **any other component**, hence the [inversion of control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control) paradigm.

## The `as` prop

The `as` prop is what enables _inversion of control_ (IOC).
You can pass any prop that the `as` component or JSX Element supports.

For example, if you're using the `<Button>` component, and want to render it as an _HTML anchor_, you can supply `as="a"` and the `<Button>` component will then _also_ accept the `href` prop and any other props that an _HTML anchor_ accepts. It will no longer accept the props that an _HTML button_ accepts, however (like the `form` prop).

You can also use the `as` prop to supply your components or other third-party components (that take the standard `className` prop!).

For example, if you're using [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/), you can pass its `<Link>` component to `<Button>`, and use it's props:

`<Button as={Link} to="/somewhere">Go somewhere</Button>`

All components have a default `as` prop value, and that is called out in each component's _API Docs_, both in a _tag_ and in the _props table_.

As an added bonus, _TypeScript_ will _also_ typecheck the props of the component or JSX Element that you've provided to the `as` prop!

## Ref forwarding

It can be frustrating when your refs get lost.
That is, you want to control or access an underlying HTML element, but you can't access it, because you don't have access to it.

All user-components support _ref forwarding_, so you can pass a React `Ref` (a function that has the shape `(target: HTMLElement) => void` or a `RefObject` as created by `React.createRef()`) – and then you'll have access t the underlying component or element.

This is especially useful when working with forms!
